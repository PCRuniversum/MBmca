\title{Surface melting curve data from direct hybridization experiment of short
oligonucleotides.}
\format{
A data frame with the melting curves of two different capture and
detection probe pairs for HRPT1 and MLC-2v. First column contains the
temperature (in degree Celsius, 1 degree Celsius per step) followed by
melting curves of HRPT1 on twelve microbead populations and melting curves
of MLC-2v on twelve microbead populations.  \describe{ \item{T}{a

\description{
A melting curve experiment with twelve microbead populations and the short
oligonucleotide capture probe and detection probe for human HRPT1
(hyperparathyroidism 1) and MLC-2v (myosin regulatory light chain 2,
ventricular/cardiac muscle isoform).
}
\details{
The melting curve was conducted with short oligonucleotide probes on the
surface of microbeads using the VideoScan platform according to Roediger et
al. (2012). The dyes and quencher used were Atto 647N and BHQ2.
