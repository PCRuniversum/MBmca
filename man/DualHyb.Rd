\description{
A melting curve experiment with four microbead populations and short
oligonucleotide probes (direct hybridization) and longer probes
(dual-hybridization probes) capture probe. Detection probes for human VIM
(vimentin), MLC-2v (myosin regulatory light chain 2, ventricular/cardiac
muscle isoform) and SERCA2 (Atp2a2 - ATPase, Calcium-transporting ATPase
sarcoplasmic reticulum type, slow twitch skeletal muscle isoform). One
sequence of VIM contained a mutation at position 41.
}
\details{
The melting curve was conducted with short oligonucleotide probes (direct
hybridization) and longer probes (dual-hybridization probes) on the surface
of microbeads (sequences and materials according to Roediger et al.  (2013))
using the VideoScan platform by Roediger et al. (2013). The dyes and
quencher used were Atto 647N and BHQ2.
