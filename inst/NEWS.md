[March 2021]
The development of the MBmca package began more than 10 years ago. In 2013, 
MBmca was published in The R Journal with a followup publication in 2015 also 
in The R Journal. There are sometimes users who give feedback to the package. Up 
to a few bugs there were no hints for new features. Recently the package was 
removed from CRAN due to its connection to the chipPCR package. The later was 
removed because the developer email no longer existed. We used the time to make 
some beauty repairs and to adjust the package to 2021. It appears that the 
package is feature complete and used in reviewed publications. Therefore we 
change to version 1.0+.
