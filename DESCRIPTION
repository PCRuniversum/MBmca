Description: The MBmca package provides data sets and lightweight utilities for
    nucleic acid melting curve analysis and presentation on microbead surfaces
    but also for reactions in solution (e.g., qPCR). The package was described 
    in detail in the publications Roediger S., Surface Melting Curve Analysis 
    with R, The R Journal. 5 (2013) 37–53. and Roediger S., R as an Environment 
    for the Reproducible Analysis of DNA Amplification Experiments, 
    The R Journal. 7 (2015) 127–150.
